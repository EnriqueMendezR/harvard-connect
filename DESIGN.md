# Project Design

Hello, so as we mentioned previously, we used an array of languages to code Harvard Huddle. These include Vite, TypeScript (a more expansive version of Javascript), React, shadcn-ui, and Tailwind CSS for our frontend and Node.js, Express, and SQL for our backend.

Most of the app code can be found in the source folder (/src). Specificallyl referring to react components, pages, styles, tailwind css, etc. Here we find main.tsx and this is where the React portion that was linked in the index.html file can be found. 

In the public file, we can find mostly static files that are served without any dynamic components.
