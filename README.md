# User's manual for running the project

Hey Mohamed! We're Arman and Enrique and we're really excited to show you what we've been working on these last few weeks. We began by brainstorming ideas of potential apps, creating several versions that then led to the development of a prompt that was input to Lovable, an AI website creator. We encoutered several difficulties such as trying to connect a Firestore Firebase to the application but found it to often crash the entire application. Therefore, we stuck with running the application locally. We also used Claude, Gemini, ChatGPT to add onto our process of app creation. However, we have commented all throughout our code to demonstrate that we understand the function of each part. We used Vite, TypeScript (a more expansive version of Javascript), React, shadcn-ui, and Tailwind CSS for our frontend and Node.js, Express, and SQL for our backend. With the main structure out the way, we introduce you to Harvard Huddle: 

Harvard Huddle is a website that facilitates hanging out, studying together, and other social interactions by connecting activity organizers with potential participants, closing the gap between them and allowing friendships to easily develop. The website addresses the issue of social isolation at Harvard by enabling activity-based connections rather than going through the sometimes uncomfortable path of having to ask groups of people that do not have the same interests as you.
